                        Hi, I&rsquo;m Benjamin👋 From a young age, I was captivated by video games and computers. I can remember my first days playing Duke Nukem and Donkey Kong Country like it was yesterday; these games sparked my early interest in technology. Twenty-five years down the line, with a BSc in Computer Science, I am now a professional developer with 8 years of commercial experience. Throughout my years as a developer, I have amassed a deep knowledge of web development, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in this field.<br /><br />
                        Four years ago, I began experimenting with Python to &quot;automate the boring stuff&quot; as they say. Since then, it has become a powerful tool in my work. I have developed numerous automation programs, web scrapers, and other solutions that have significantly enhanced my efficiency and productivity.<br /> <br />

                        I&rsquo;m also a part-time content creator on Twitch, where I stream retro games (of course 🕹️). Streaming can be very tech-heavy, with the myriad of possibilities available these days, which is why it resonates with me! So yeah, I thought I would create a little website to showcase some of my achievements over my journey.🚀
