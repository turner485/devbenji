Four years ago, I began playing around with Python to "automate the boring stuff" as they say and it has since become an powerful tool in my work. I have developed numerous automation programs, web scrapers, and other solutions that have significantly enhanced my efficiency and productivity.<br /><br />I'm also a part time content creator over on twitch, I stream retro (of course 🕹️) Streaming can be very tech heavy, with the amount of stuff you can do these days, so i feel that's why is resonates with me! So yeah, I'd just thought I would create a little website to showcase some of my achievements over my journey.🚀
